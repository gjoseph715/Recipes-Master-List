# Recipe Websites Master List
- This has been a long time coming! I've been collecting recipe websites for forever and I'm finally getting them organized. 
- Every website will be in 1-3 different sections. Some websites focus on more than one thing (ex. if it's Italian, vegan, & gluten-free, it will be listed in each of those sections). 
- Websites in a particular category **do not ONLY offer recipes of that kind**; that German website might have some delicious keto stuff. I don't know, I haven't looked through them all, but you can. Life is all about exploration. 
- If a website doesn't seem to have a particular focus on anything, it will be in the **Miscellaneous** section.
- When it comes to which category a website is placed in, I usually go by how the About section identifies it (if they self-describe as Easy, etc).
- These all have written recipes. Some may have accompanying videos, but the focus here is on text.
- All of these websites are written in English and vary on whether they use metric vs. imperial measurements. 
- Brand websites with a recipes section have been bolded.
- Please alert me if there are any dead links or a website is miscategorized! I will try to update as soon as I can.
